# Learning Time Repository

This repository contains various learning modules organized in different branches. Each branch represents a specific module or topic that I'm learning.

## Repository Structure

- Different modules are organized in separate branches
- Each branch contains its own specific content and exercises
- Master/Main branch contains the base repository information

## How to Navigate

1. To see all available modules/branches:
   ```bash
   git branch -a
   ```

2. To switch to a specific module:
   ```bash
   git checkout branch-name
   ```

## Modules/Branches

As you learn new topics, create new branches and update this list:
